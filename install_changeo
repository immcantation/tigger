Install development tools:
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))

Install prereqs:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "igraph", "plyr", "scales", "SDMTools", "seqinr", 
"stringr", "zoo", "reshape2"))

Install Change-O R packages:
library(devtools)
install_bitbucket("uduman/shm", ref="tip", auth_user="youruser",
password="yourpassword")
install_bitbucket("javh/alakazam", ref="tip", auth_user="youruser",
password="yourpassword")

NOTE: This does not build the man pages and vignettes, so it's more for a cluster
install. To build the man pages and vignettes, the easiest thing to do is follow 
the README.md on bitbucket.org/javh/alakazam and then from Rstudio do either 
"Build" -> "Build and Reload" (for local install) or "Build" -> "Build Source 
Package" (makes a source package to install elsewhere according to the 
instructions on the Change-O website). Alternatively, you could run (with the 
package repo as the working directory):

library(roxygen2)
library(devtools)
roxygenize()
build()
install()


Change-O commandline tools:
Same requirements as pRESTO, except you also need the python package rpy2, as well 
as the shm R package installed.  And for the version from Bitbucket (which you 
should use), you'll need to either copy IgCore.py from pRESTO into the same 
directory or add the pRESTO directory to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
