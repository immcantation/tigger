**novel_df** - *Example of Analyzed Rep-Seq data*

Description
--------------------

Example VDJ-rearranged immunoglobulin Rep-Seq sequences derived from a single
individual (PGP1), sequenced on the Roche 454 platform, and thought by
IMGT/V-QUEST to utilize IGHV1 family alleles, as processed by
[findNovelAlleles](findNovelAlleles.md).




Format
-------------------
A `data.frame` where rows correspond to alleles checked for
polymorphisms and columns give results as well as paramaters used to run
the test.
