Description
--------------------

Example VDJ-rearranged immunoglobulin Rep-Seq sequences derived from a single
individual (PGP1), sequenced on the Roche 454 platform, and thought by
IMGT/V-QUEST to utilize IGHV1 family alleles.




Format
-------------------
A `data.frame` where rows correspond to unique VDJ sequences and
columns include:

+  IMGT-gapped nucleotide sequence (`"SEQUENCE_IMGT"`)
+  IMGT/V-QUEST allele calls (`"V_CALL"`, `"D_CALL"`, and
`"J_CALL"`)
+  Junction length (`"JUNCTION_LENGTH"`)
