**SampleNovel** - *Example novel allele detection results*

Description
--------------------

A `data.frame` of novel allele detection results from [findNovelAlleles](findNovelAlleles.md). 
Source data was a collection of V(D)J immunoglobulin sequences derived from a single
individual (PGP1), sequenced on the Roche 454 platform, and assigned by
IMGT/HighV-QUEST to IGHV1 family alleles.






Format
-------------------

A `data.frame` where rows correspond to alleles checked for
polymorphisms and columns give results as well as paramaters used to run
the test.
