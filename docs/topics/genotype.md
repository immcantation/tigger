Description
--------------------

Example VDJ-rearranged immunoglobulin Rep-Seq sequences derived from a single
individual (PGP1), sequenced on the Roche 454 platform, and thought by
IMGT/V-QUEST to utilize IGHV1 family alleles, as processed by
[findNovelAlleles](findNovelAlleles.md) and [inferGenotype](inferGenotype.md)




Format
-------------------
A `data.frame` where rows correspond to genes carried by an
individual and columns lists the alleles of those genes and their counts.
